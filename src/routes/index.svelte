	<h1>Hi there.</h1>
	<p>My name is Reed Gaines, and I'm a web developer based in Brooklyn.</p>
	<p>
		Born and raised in Madison, Wisconsin, I moved out East for college, earning a B.A. from
    Vassar College and an M.F.A. from Brown University.
	</p>
  <p>
    I've been a tech support guy, a writer, an educator, and now, I'm a technologist.
  </p>
  <p>
    What motivates me? Kind people. Meaningful projects. Clean code. And most importantly, my family, friends, and life outside of my work.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thanks for stopping by!
